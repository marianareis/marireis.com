				<h3>Bras-ilha</h3>
				<p>There are only 2 generations of people born and raised in the overly modernist capital of Brazil, Brasília, and I'm in one of them. This project compiles pieces of work from different creatives who are natives and present their own views of how they have gained ownership of the city.</p>
				<p>The book features 5 photographers, two of which are also movie makers and artists, 1 musician, 1 journalist, 1 copy writer, 1 writer and poet, 4 graphic designers, and 4 fine artists.</p>

        <h3>Investigating Typography</h3>
        <p>One of the projects that reveal my interest in typography and it’s variations as a message conveyer. I wanted my investigation to be interesting to someone who wasn’t acquainted with typography, so I aimed to make it entertaining in some level. Some aspects of the book become much clearer once you use UV light on it, creating a treasure hunt feel to it.</p>
				<p>It approaches 4 main aspects of typography and their variations in an A3 Risograph 8 page booklet (that is also a poster on the reverse), printed in black and fluorescent orange.</p>

        <h3>Intervenciones</h3>
        <p>Project done for the workshop Books From the Future with Joshua Trees and Yvan Martinez.</p>
				<p>The project consisted in making a conceptual book for the artist Jaime Gili, where the book itself should translate aspects of Jaime's work.</p>
				<p>The whole book is chopped in half at the bottom, turning the reading of the text and the image experiences independent and interchangeable.</p>

        <h3>Secret Brand</h3>
        <p>The aim in this project was to create a secret brand entitled Secret Emergency Can, concentrating on the narrative as the main selling point. </p>
				<p>The idea revolves around collectible cans that contain items to prepare you for a series of daily situations that are taken as emergencies. Inside the cans, there are 4-5 items and a guide. The themes are undisclosed till you open the can, and are changeable.</p>
